Overview

In this task, I created a personal profile webpage using HTML5 and focused on writing clean, meaningful, and well-structured markup. The goal was to understand how real websites are structured using semantic HTML elements instead of generic <div> tags.

What I Did

Created a project folder with an index.html file following proper naming conventions.

Wrote the full HTML boilerplate manually to understand document structure.

Used semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to logically organize the content.

Added personal information such as my name, bio, skills, education, projects, and experience using headings, paragraphs, and lists.

Included internal navigation using anchor links to jump between sections on the same page.

Used <article> elements for projects and experience to keep each item self-contained.

Added comments (during development) to understand why semantic elements are better than <div> tags.

What I Learned

How semantic HTML improves readability, accessibility, and structure.

How browsers and screen readers understand a page better when correct elements are used.

How to organize content in a way that is scalable and professional.
